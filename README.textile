h3. requirements / installation

ScalaInterpreterPane currently compiles against the Scala 2.8.0.RC1. The repository contains a project file for Intellij IDEA 9 CE, and project files for sbt. Standard targets for sbt:

* @clean@
* @compile@
* @doc@
* @package@

To install the dependancy on JSyntaxPane v0.9.5-b29 ( "code.google.com/p/jsyntaxpane":http://code.google.com/p/jsyntaxpane/ ), run @sbt update@ once before compiling.

Note that due to an incompatibility between Scala 2.8.0-RC1 and sbt 0.7.3, it is not possible to run using @sbt run@. Instead, you will need to use the provided shell script @run.sh@.
